They're even accessible very easily. Here I would like to build up a totally free - without risk of payment by mistake - Jigsaw puzzle app. Actually my kid love to play Jigsaw puzzle on the Android device. I occationally notice him get disappointed when he face the payment menu in certain way. Most of the extended functions with full feature are not free. I, as an engineer with knowledge on Android platform, decided to make a toy for him - letting him free from such a frustration.\r\nSpeaking about the motivation, this is it.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIf you're interested in improving this project in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me (@yeegahng).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
