{"name":"MyJigsaw","tagline":"Make your own Jigsaw puzzle with any picture!","body":"### Welcome to MyJigsaw Page.\r\nThis page is to show the roadmap of the Android app project 'MyJigsaw', providing a list of to-do in software implementation.\r\nYou can clone the repository as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/yeegahng/MyJigsaw.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Objective of MyJigsaw\r\nYes, we all know that there are tons of Android apps for Jigsaw puzzle, including freewares. They're even accessible with ease.\r\nActually, my kid love to play Jigsaw puzzle on the Android device. I occationally notice him getting disappointed when he face the payment menu in the apps for further feature. Most of the extended functions with full feature are not free. I, as an engineer with knowledge on Android platform, decided to make a toy for him - letting him free from such a frustration.\r\nSpeaking about the motivation, this is it.\r\n\r\n### What to be done here\r\nHere I would like to build up a totally free - without risk of payment by mistake - Jigsaw puzzle app.\r\nAs described in the headline, the app wouldn't include any commercial advertizement, limitation against the free users. Meanwhile, it will try to include more features, such as variety of background sound and so forth.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIf you're interested in improving this project in any way, please do not hesitate to contact @yeegahng, or push your commit request. Any one who is willing to join my 'daddy-job' is welcomed to be a contributor.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n#####Phase 1. Tile rotation\r\n1. Picture loading\r\n ①from built-in asset,\r\n ②from user-selected local resource,\r\n ③from user-selected remote resource (web URI)\r\n2. Saving loaded picture\r\n3. Segmentation\r\n ①break picture into 9 tiles,\r\n ②break picture into N tiles\r\n4. Mess up\r\n ①all,\r\n ②at step level,\r\n ③at random\r\n5. Step levels: 1 -> 2 -> ... -> N (random)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
