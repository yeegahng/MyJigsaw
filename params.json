{"name":"MyJigsaw","tagline":"Make your own Jigsaw puzzle with any picture!","body":"### Welcome to MyJigsaw Pages.\r\nThis page is to show the roadmap of the Android app project 'MyJigsaw', providing a list of to-do in software implementation.\r\nYou can clone the repository as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/yeegahng/MyJigsaw.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Objective of MyJigsaw\r\nYes, we all know that there are tons of Android apps for Jigsaw puzzle, including freewares. They're even accessible very easily. Here I would like to build up a totally free - without risk of payment by mistake - Jigsaw puzzle app. Actually my kid love to play Jigsaw puzzle on the Android device. I occationally notice him get disappointed when he face the payment menu in certain way. Most of the extended functions with full feature are not free. I, as an engineer with knowledge on Android platform, decided to make a toy for him - letting him free from such a frustration.\r\nSpeaking about the motivation, this is it.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIf you're interested in improving this project in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me (@yeegahng).\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n#####Phase 1. Tile rotation\r\n1. Picture loading\r\n  a. from built-in asset\r\n  b. from user-selected local resource\r\n  c. from user-selected remote resource (web URI)\r\n2. Saving loaded picture\r\n3. Segmentation\r\n  a. break picture into 9 tiles\r\n  b. break picture into N tiles\r\n4. Mess up\r\n  a. all\r\n  b. by step level\r\n  b. at random\r\n5. Step levels: 1 -> 2 -> ... -> N (random)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
