<p>Yes, we all know that there are tons of Android apps for Jigsaw puzzle, including freewares. They're even accessible with ease.
Actually, my kid love to play Jigsaw puzzle on the Android device. I occationally notice him getting disappointed when he face the payment menu in the apps for further feature. Most of the extended functions with full feature are not free. I, as an engineer with knowledge on Android platform, decided to make a toy for him - letting him free from such a frustration.
Speaking about the motivation, this is it.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-to-be-done-here" class="anchor" href="#what-to-be-done-here"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What to be done here</h3>

<p>Here I would like to build up a totally free - without risk of payment by mistake - Jigsaw puzzle app.
As described in the headline, the app wouldn't include any commercial advertizement, limitation against the free users. Meanwhile, it will try to include more features, such as variety of background sound and so forth.</p>
